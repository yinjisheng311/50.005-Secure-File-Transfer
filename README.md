# 50.005-Secure-File-Transfer

This is a programming assignment for Computer Systems Engineering (CSE) module for Spring Term 2017 for Singapore University of Technology and Design. The assignment is to implement a secure file transfer protocol using, first, asymmetric key crypto and second, symmetric key crypto and then compare the runtime of the two. 

Asymmetric key crypto is done using RSA algorithm and symmetric key crypto is done using AES algorithm. The latter proved to be much faster in terms of runtime.
